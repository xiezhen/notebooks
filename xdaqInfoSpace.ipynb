    "For the Application to be configurable, we inherit from xdata::ActionListener, attach to and implement the callback \"actionPerformed\"for the xdata Event \"xdaq-event:setDefaultValues\". \n",
    "\n",
    "All applications loaded by the executive share a special infospace whose handle we acquire with getApplicationInfoSpace(). We declare a named parameter in the application infospace by firing itemavailable event. The framework listens to this event and matches the application properties in the xml file with parameters in application infospaces and fires \"xdaq-event:setDefaultValues\" when done. xmlns= attribute in the application property refers to the name of the application infospace.\n",

    "Our application get notified only if it is a infospace event listener, so we must add appInfoSpace->addListener(this, \"urn:xdaq-event:setDefaultValues\");\n",
    "\n",
    "While Configuration is a usecase of sharing data using the special application infospace, Monitoring is a more general usecase of infospace infrastructure. We can create as many infospaces as we need. Different applications in the same process can attach to a common infospace to coordinate activities or exchange data. For example, Application A and B are attached to a common infospace, A will do something only if variable \"run\" is changed by B. \n",
