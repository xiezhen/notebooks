    " SmartDataSource is a xdaq application who is capable of self-regulating the queue population. The queue is filled with a workloop \"pushing\" and popped with a workloop \"popping\" where the pushing rate is twice of the popping rate initially. A **\"QueueAlmostFull\"** event is fired by the application when the queue size reaches 80% of its max allowed size. Reacting to this event, the queue popping rate is increased by a factor of 2. A **\"QueueAlmostEmpty\"** event is fired when the queue size reaches 20% of its max size. Reacting to this event, the queue popping rate is decreased by a factor of 2. It is the dynamic change in the popping rate that keeps the queue size in balance. \n",
