    "XDAQ is event-driven. The flow of the program is determined by events: something happens (Event Call-Back) only when something else (Event) happens. The main thread listens for events, then triggers callback functions when one of those events is detected. Since timing and synchronisation is vital to online applications, event-driven programming ensures nothing blocks or delays the flow of the main thread (asynchronous execution). \n",

    "A typical scenario is: as a reaction to an event, you start processing a lot of data, if the processing is done in the main thread it could delay the program flow since it takes so long time. In this case, you should move the data processing to a new thread, i.e. launch a xdaq workloop. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### When testing eventing, test against your own eventing server or the mirror server\n",
